        <h1>Quick Hummus Recipe</h1>
    </header>
    <section class="main-text">
        <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>
        <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
           <ul>
                <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
                <li>175g of tahini</li>
                <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
                <li>Half a red pepper</li>
                <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
                <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <!-- <ol>
                <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.</li>
                <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely.</li>
                <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor.</li>
                <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
                <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.</li>
                <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>
            </ol> -->
            <ol>
                <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.</li>
                <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely.</li>
                <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor.</li>
                <li>
                  Process all the ingredients into a paste.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
            <p>For a different flavor, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>
            <h2>Storage</h2>
            <p><em>Refrigerate</em> <mark>the finished hummus</mark> in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>
            <p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
