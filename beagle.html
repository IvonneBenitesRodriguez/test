            <p class="text-first">Japanese roses are the most unique flowers with a pink tone, sometimes
                these flowers can be confused with other type of roses or flowers.
                The last time I traveled to Japan, I could distinguish the several pink tones
                this beautiful flower has. It is not only the color but also the smell it 
                gives you which can be easily compared to a exquisite piece of art nature provides us.

        <p class="text-first title-second">Oregan, Rossmary, Lemongrass, Thyme are the most unique herbs with a fabulous smell, sometimes
            these herbs can be the main key to a delicious meal.
            The last time I traveled to Sevilla, I met an extraordinary woman named Maria, she invited me 
            to her garden which I though it would be a small piece of heart.
            My surprise was once we arrived to the most stunning green and sunny area surrounder by a nice river 
            the most magic smell made dream with tons of recipes which I wanted to immediately create.
            A very useful word in spanish to say a dish was delicious is <i>Estuvo exquisito gracias</i>, i recommend to
            use it specially once you are invited for a meal.

    In Spain, you'll find a wide range of eateries, from small family-owned bars and restaurants to large fast-food chains. Small bars and bakeries ( Pastelerias ) are popular for breakfast, and many offer freshly baked bread, croissants, and pastries.
For lunch, the locals often enjoy a "menÃº del dÃ­a" (menu of the day) which is a set meal that includes 2 to 3 courses at very reasonable prices.
For dinner, there are plenty of options, from trendy gastro bars serving creative tapas to Michelin-starred restaurants.

        If you're looking for a casual meal, you can't go wrong with a visit to a local tapas or Pintxos bar, where you can enjoy a variety of delicious low-cost small dishes that are perfect for sharing. 
    </aside>
    <p class="text-first title-second">
